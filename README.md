# Rounded Measurement Templates

Round Foundry VTT measurement templates to the nearest size or angle.

## About

Forked from the archived [FVTT Rounded Distance for Measured Templates](https://github.com/cdverrett94/FVTT-rounded-distance-for-measured-templates).

Includes the abandoned [Cone Measurement Angle](https://github.com/thre-z/cone-measurement-angle) library.

## Usage

Rounds the distance of your measured templates the nearest multiple while you are drawing them.

By default it rounds to nearest grid space.

There is an option to round to a custom number or to round to the nearest item in a set array.

If you want to round to the nearest whole number and get rid of decimal places in your distance, set the custom rounding multiple to 1.

There are also settings to have the rotation angle of cones and rays be rounded to set angle multiples. 

## Issues

This module may not work with game systems or addons which already implement their own measurement templates.

If you encounter any problems, raise a ticket on Github and I'll take a look.
