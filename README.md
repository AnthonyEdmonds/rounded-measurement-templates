# rounded-measured-templates

This module rounds your measured template to the nearest number set. By default, it rounds to the nearest multiple of your grid units of the scene. So for 5ft grids, it'll round to the nearest multiple of 5ft. If you change the multiple number in the settings, it will round to the nearest multiple of that number. Setting to 1 will make it round to the nearest whole number.
