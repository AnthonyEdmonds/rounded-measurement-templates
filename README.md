# Rounded Distance for Measured Templates

Rounds the distance of your measured templates the nearest multiple while you are drawing them. By default it rounds to nearest grid space. There is an option to round to a custom number or to round to the nearet item in a set array. If you want to round to the nearest whole number and get rid of decimal places in your distance, set the custom rounding multiple to 1. There are also setting to have the rotation angle of you cones and rays be rounded to set angle multiples.
